# CI/CD with GitHub Actions and OIDC

**Contract:** when this skill ends, `.github/workflows/build.yml` and `deploy.yml`
are committed, `main` accepts changes only through pull requests that pass the
`build` check, and every push to `main` deploys the package to the test environment
via workload identity federation. No secret material is stored — only identifiers
(client id, tenant id, environment URL). This skill talks to GitHub and Entra ID;
run it only when the user asked for CI/CD.

**Branching model — trunk-based.** Everyone integrates into `main` through
short-lived topic branches (a day or two, named `users/<name>/<topic>`) and pull
requests. Long-lived feature branches drift away from main and end in merge hell:
the longer a branch lives, the bigger and riskier the merge.

## Step 1 — Prerequisites and inputs (once)

Verify sign-ins, then gather everything up front and do not re-prompt:

```
gh auth status
az account show --query tenantId -o tsv
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner
```

1. **Repository** `<owner>/<repo>` — from `gh repo view` above (the origin remote,
   not an upstream parent).
2. **Tenant id** — from `az account show` above.
3. **Test environment URL** — e.g. `https://yourenv.crm4.dynamics.com`, no trailing slash.
4. **Deploy app name** — Entra app registration display name, e.g. `<solutionname>-deploy`.
5. **Required PR approvals** — 0 suits a solo repository; a real team requires >= 1.

Pushing files under `.github/workflows` needs the `workflow` scope; if
`gh auth status` does not list it:

```
gh auth refresh -h github.com -s workflow
```

## Step 2 — Protect main

Create a branch ruleset on the default branch: no direct pushes (PRs only), no
deletion, no force pushes. Exact JSON payload and `gh api` commands:
[ci-cd-branch-ruleset.md](ci-cd-branch-ruleset.md). Keep the ruleset `id`
from the response — the build-check update below needs it.

## Step 3 — Federated deploy identity (Entra)

App registration + service principal, then a federated credential trusting this
repository's `main` branch:

```
appId=$(az ad app create --display-name <deploy-app-name> --query appId -o tsv)
az ad sp create --id $appId
```

Write `fed.json` (the `subject` must match owner/repo exactly):

```json
{
  "name": "github-main",
  "issuer": "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com",
  "subject": "repo:<owner>/<repo>:ref:refs/heads/main",
  "audiences": ["api://AzureADTokenExchange"]
}
```

```
az ad app federated-credential create --id $appId --parameters @fed.json
```

## Step 4 — Application user in the test environment

The service principal must exist as an application user in the Dataverse test
environment. Do it via the Dataverse OData API — `pac admin assign-user` requires an
interactive pac auth profile that is not available in CI or headless shells, while
`az` is already authenticated. Exact call sequence:
[ci-cd-application-user.md](ci-cd-application-user.md).

Least-privilege note: System Administrator is the simple default; in production give
the deploy principal a custom role scoped to what package imports actually need, and
never a tenant-level Power Platform admin role.

## Step 5 — Secrets and workflows

Store the three identifiers as repository secrets (identifiers, not credentials —
with OIDC there is nothing here to leak and replay):

```
gh secret set AZURE_CLIENT_ID    --repo <owner>/<repo> --body $appId
gh secret set AZURE_TENANT_ID    --repo <owner>/<repo> --body <tenant-id>
gh secret set DATAVERSE_TEST_URL --repo <owner>/<repo> --body <test-env-url>
```

On a fork, GitHub Actions is disabled by default:

```
gh api -X PUT "repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/permissions" -F enabled=true -f allowed_actions=all
```

Copy `build.yml` and `deploy.yml` from
[ci-cd-workflows.md](ci-cd-workflows.md) into `.github/workflows/`,
replacing `<SolutionName>` with the repository's `.slnx` name. `build` compiles
Release on every PR and push to main and publishes the `.pdpkg.zip` as the `drop`
artifact; `deploy` triggers via `workflow_run` when build succeeds on main, requests
an OIDC token (`permissions: id-token: write`), and imports the package through a
txc federated profile. Land them through a topic branch and PR — main is protected
now, and the PR exercises the loop you just built.

## Step 6 — Require the build check

After the `build` workflow has reported at least once, update the ruleset so PRs
cannot merge unless `build` passes and the branch is up to date with main. The PUT
replaces the whole `rules` array — send every rule, not just the addition; payload
in [ci-cd-branch-ruleset.md](ci-cd-branch-ruleset.md). Broken solutions
can no longer reach main.

## Step 7 — Validate and summarize

```
gh pr checks <pr-number> --watch
gh run list --workflow deploy --limit 1
```

A PR must show `build` as a required check; after it merges, the deploy run must
finish successfully against the test environment. Report exactly: the ruleset name
and rules, the app registration (client id) and its federated credential subject,
the three secrets set, and both workflow files committed.
